# RandomForestClassifier
The RandomForestClassifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. 
It belongs to the category of ensemble methods, which means it combines multiple models (in this case, decision trees) to improve the overall performance and accuracy.

## RandomForestClassifier Works on:
### Decision Trees: 
A Random Forest consists of many individual decision trees, each of which is trained on a random subset of the training data and features.
Each decision tree acts like an expert making its own prediction.

### Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation): 
To create diversity among the decision trees, Random Forest uses a technique called bagging. 
It trains each tree on a different random sample of the data (with replacement), and also randomly selects features for each split in the tree.

### Majority Voting (for Classification): 
After training, each decision tree in the forest makes a prediction for the input data. 
The final output of the RandomForestClassifier is determined by a majority vote: the class that most trees predict is chosen as the final classification.
